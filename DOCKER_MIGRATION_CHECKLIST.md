- [ ] Deploy and test: `curl https://criminalip-service-docker.onrender.com/health`
- [ ] Delete old service after success

#### PhishTank Service  
- [ ] Create new Docker service: `phishtank-service-docker`
- [ ] Configure Dockerfile path: `./services/phishtank-service/Dockerfile.render`
- [ ] Set environment variables

- [ ] Delete old service after success

#### Link Service
- [ ] Create new Docker service: `link-service-docker`
- [ ] Configure Dockerfile path: `./services/link-service/Dockerfile.render`
- [ ] Set environment variables (VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY, etc.)
- [ ] Deploy and test: `curl https://link-service-docker.onrender.com/health`
- [ ] Delete old service after success

#### API Gateway
- [ ] Create new Docker service: `api-gateway-docker`
- [ ] Configure Dockerfile path: `./services/api-gateway/Dockerfile.render`
- [ ] Update service URLs to point to Docker services
- [ ] Set environment variables
- [ ] Deploy and test: `curl https://api-gateway-docker.onrender.com/health`
- [ ] Delete old service after success

### Phase 2: Working Services (Optional)

#### Auth Service

- [ ] Test and switch traffic

#### News Service
- [ ] Create new Docker service: `news-service-docker`

## ðŸ§ª Post-Migration Testing

- [ ] All health endpoints responding
- [ ] API Gateway routing working
- [ ] Frontend connecting to new API Gateway
- [ ] All external API integrations working
- [ ] Performance monitoring shows improvements

## ðŸ”„ Final Steps

- [ ] Update DNS/domain configurations if needed
- [ ] Update CI/CD pipeline to use Docker deployment
