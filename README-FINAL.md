## 📋 **Working Commands**

| **Command** | **What It Does** | **Status** |
|-------------|------------------|------------|
| `npm start` | Start full stack (all services + client) | ✅ **WORKING** |
| `npm stop` | Stop all services | ✅ **WORKING** |
| `npm restart` | Restart everything | ✅ **WORKING** |
| `npm run status` | Check what's running | ✅ **WORKING** |
| `npm run setup` | Install all dependencies | ✅ **WORKING** |

## 🔧 **What Was Fixed**

### **❌ Problems Before:**
- `npm start` would hang and never complete
- Complex script dependencies causing failures
- Windows compatibility issues with npm/node spawning
- Port conflict detection not working
- Redis startup failures blocking everything
- 20+ confusing scripts that didn't work

### **✅ Solutions Applied:**
- **Simplified to 3 working scripts**: `simple-start.js`, `simple-stop.js`, `simple-status.js`
- **Fixed Windows npm.cmd issues**: Proper shell spawning
- **Non-blocking startup**: Services start in background, don't wait for full initialization
- **Reliable port cleanup**: PowerShell-based process killing on Windows
- **Graceful Redis handling**: Continues without Redis if not available
- **Clear status reporting**: Shows exactly what's running vs stopped

## 🌐 **Access URLs**

After running `npm start`, access:

- **Auth Service**: http://localhost:3001
- **Link Service**: http://localhost:3002
- **Community Service**: http://localhost:3003
- **Chat Service**: http://localhost:3004

## 🛠️ **Troubleshooting**

### **If services won't start:**
```bash
npm stop          # Force stop everything
npm start         # Try again
```

### **If ports are in use:**
```bash
npm stop          # This also fixes port conflicts
npm run status    # Check what's still running
npm start         # Start fresh
```

### **If you see "ENOENT" errors:**
- Make sure you're in the project root directory
- Run `npm install` first
- Check that services directories exist
