## 📋 Implementation Details

### Event Handler Integration
Each microservice now includes:
- **Event Handler Class** - Centralized event management
- **Controller Integration** - Events published on business actions
- **Event Subscriptions** - Cross-service communication
- **Health Monitoring** - Status and diagnostics

### Event Structure
```javascript
{
  id: "service-timestamp-randomId",
  type: "domain:action",
  data: { /* business data */ },
  source: "service-name",
  timestamp: "2025-07-15T15:26:50.704Z",
  version: "1.0",
  correlationId: "correlation-id",
  metadata: { /* additional context */ }
}
```

## 🔍 Verification and Logging

### Event Sourcing Verification
All events are logged with detailed information:
- ✅ Event type and unique ID
- ✅ Business data payload
- ✅ Source service identification
- ✅ Timestamp for ordering
- ✅ Correlation IDs for tracing

### Demo Script Output
```
🎉 DEMO COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY!
✅ All microservices event sourcing working
✅ Cross-service event flow demonstrated
✅ Event persistence and retrieval working
✅ Event analytics and monitoring functional
✅ Fallback mechanisms operational
```

## 🎯 Business Value Delivered

### 1. **Complete Audit Trail**
Every business action is now captured as an immutable event:
- User authentication and authorization
- Community interactions (posts, comments, votes)
- Security analysis and threat detection

### 2. **Real-time Monitoring**
